# week2
This repository includes the Week 2 progress of the Forest Fire Detection project using deep learning. The main focus this week was on preprocessing the image dataset and developing a basic CNN model. Initial training was performed using TensorFlow/Keras, and results will be improved in the upcoming weeks.
