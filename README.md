# Forest Fire Detection Using Deep Learning – Week 2

## Objective
To preprocess forest fire image data and begin building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Week 2 Progress
- Preprocessed the image dataset (resizing, normalization, labeling)
- Split data into training and validation sets
- Built an initial CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trained the model with basic parameters
- Observed early accuracy and performance trends

## Sample CNN Architecture
- Input Layer: 128x128 RGB images
- Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling
- Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling
- Flatten → Dense → Output (sigmoid)

## Next Steps
- Tune model hyperparameters
- Improve accuracy with data augmentation
- Add evaluation metrics and confusion matrix

## Tools Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
